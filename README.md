# Rename MP3 files

This script allows you to remove specified target strings from the beginning and the end of the filenames of all MP3 files in the current directory.

## Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Save the script to a file with a `.py` extension, for example `rename_files.py`.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script using the Python interpreter: `python rename_files.py`
4. When prompted, enter the target string to remove from the beginning of the filenames.
5. When prompted, enter the target string to remove from the end of the filenames.

The script will then rename all MP3 files in the current directory by removing the specified target strings from the beginning and the end of the filenames.

## Note

Make sure that you have permission to modify the filenames of the MP3 files in the current directory.
